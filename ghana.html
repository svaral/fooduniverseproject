 <p><bold> Ghanaian cuisine</bold>  is the cuisine of the Ghanaian people.
 Ghanaian main dishes are organized around a starchy staple
 food, with which goes a sauce or soup containing a protein
  sauce. The main ingredient for the vast majority of soups
  and stews are tomatoes- canned or fresh tomatoes can be used. As a result,
   nearly all Ghanaian soups and stews are red or orange in appearance.</p>

<p>The typical staple foods in the southern part of Ghana include cassava and plantain.
 In the northern part, the main staple foods include millet and sorghum. Yam, maize and
  beans are used across Ghana as staple foods. Sweet potatoes and cocoyam
are also important in the Ghanaian diet and cuisine. With the advent of globalization, crops
such as rice and wheat have been increasingly incorporated into Ghanaian cuisine.</p>
