<h2> About </h2>
Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes
cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese
people in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical
power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with
modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea,
 and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide. he preference for seasoning and
  cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic groups. Geographic features
   including mountains, rivers, forests and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the
   climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial, royal and noble preference also plays a role
   in the change of Chinese cuisines. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are integrated
    into Chinese cuisines over time.

The most praised "Four Major Cuisines" are Chuan, Lu, Yue and Huaiyang, representing West, North, South and East China cuisine correspondingly.[2
